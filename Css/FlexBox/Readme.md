## What is FlexBox?
flexbox is a CSS box modal to easily layout align and distribute space among items
within a container either horizontally or vertically.

### Flex container properties
.flex-direction: row-reverse/ column-reverse;
The flex direction row/column reverse reverses the row from its main position

flex-wrap: wrap;
If there is no space for the items in the flex container, the items that are not sticking in the container will start from the next row.
